# Registration-System
Program creates a simple Username/password system.
Currently has a password authenticator that checks if the passowrd has atleast 1 capital letter, 1 number, and is at least 8 characters long.
When the user has registered and attempts to login, they have 3 tries before they get kicked out by the program.
